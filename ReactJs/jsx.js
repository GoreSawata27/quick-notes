// What is JSX?
// JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript used primarily with React.
// It allows you to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript,
// making UI structure more readable and expressive.

//  No, the browser does not understand JSX directly.

//  JSX needs to be transpiled (converted) to plain JavaScript using a
//  tool like Babel before it can run in the browser.
