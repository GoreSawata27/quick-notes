// Redux is a state management library for JavaScript applications, including React.
// It provides a centralized store to hold application state, actions to update that state,
//  and reducers to handle those updates.

// 	• Store: Holds the entire application state as a single JavaScript object tree.
// 	• Actions: Plain JavaScript objects describing the intention to change the state.
// 	• Reducers: Pure functions that accept the current state and an action, returning the new state.

// Pros of Redux:
// 	• Predictable State Management: Easier to reason about application state and track changes.
// 	• Improved Testability: Easier to test components in isolation due to centralized state.
// 	• Scalability: Well-suited for large and complex applications.

// Cons of Redux:
// 	• Boilerplate Code: Requires setting up stores, reducers, actions, and middleware.
// 	• Complexity: Learning curve for managing state with reducers and actions.
